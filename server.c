*	The manual lists save functions.

*	Sigaction is to be preferred over the signal function according to the
*	manual, because the behaviour of signal varies across UNIX versions and
*	has varied across Linux versions as well.
*	To use the sigaction function, you have to create a struct.
*	The sigaction function reacts, whenever a specific signal is sent and calls
*	the handler, to which the sigaction function is bound.
*	The signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are not used by Linux for generic process
*	operations and can be used by the user.
*	The signal() function does not block other signals when the current
*	handlerâ€™s execution is under process. At the same time, the sigaction
*	function can block other signals until the current handler has returned.
